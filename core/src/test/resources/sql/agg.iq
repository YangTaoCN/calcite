SOSO

   LogicalProject($f0=[1])
-    LogicalFilter(condition=[=($7, 10)])
+    LogicalFilter(condition=[AND(=($7, 10), <>($7, 20))])

missing is true

-    LogicalFilter(condition=[CASE(=($10, 0), false, IS TRUE(>($0, $9)), true, >($10, $11), null, >($0, $9))])
+    LogicalFilter(condition=[OR(AND(IS TRUE(>($0, $9)), <>($10, 0)), AND(>($0, $9), <>($10, 0), IS NOT TRUE(>($0, $9)), <=($10, $11)))])
