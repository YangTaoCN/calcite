Apache Calcite Avatica 1.7.0 has just been approved by the PMC. This is an
exciting release as it's a big step forward in making Avatica an agile and
easily usable project. This release of Avatica, unlike previous, is completely
separate from the Calcite "core" codebase.

This release has fewer notable issues to highlight than previous releases, however
there are still a few which might be of interest. A significant portion of the
work of this release was "Maven work" to separate the build and release processes.

It is important to note that this release also makes a minor change to the
groupId and artifactId for Avatica artifacts. Make sure to update these when
upgrading to this version.

Performance, specifical on the write path, was a big focus in this release. There
were a number of changes made which are all contained in [CALCITE-1091](CALCITE-1091).
Some of these changes were related to heap usage in the Avatica server (e.g.
[CALCITE-1092](CALCITE-1092) and [CALCITE-1093](CALCITE-1093)) while others
were strictly performance related ([CALCITE-1094](CALCITE-1094) and [CALCITE-1117](CALCITE-1117)).
[CALCITE-1117](CALCITE-1117) was the single change which has the most significant impact\
on overall performance. Using the [Apache Commons HttpComponents Client](http://hc.apache.org/)
library instead of the [HttpURLConnection](HttpURLConnection) provided in the Java
platform itself, an ~15% improvement was noticed on a pure write workload.

Two dependent libraries were also updated in this release: Jackson and Commons Logging.
Jackson was upgraded from version 2.1.1 to 2.6.3 in [CALCITE-1021](CALCITE-1021). Commons
Logging was completely removed in favor of SLF4J in [CALCITE-669](CALCITE-669). This
logging framework update should allow downstream integrators to use the logging implementation
of their choice instead of being forced to inherit Commons Logging.
